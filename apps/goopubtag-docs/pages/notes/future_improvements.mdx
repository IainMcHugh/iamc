# Future Improvements

Here is a list of things I have in mind for improving this library:

- **SSR support** to improve performance for frameworks like NextJS
- **Generics** where appropriate to allow for stricter typing on a use case basis
- **Complete examples** to match those provided by Google Publisher tag, also look at interactive examples with code sandbox
- **JSDoc comments** for props, components, guidelines etc
- **Improve documentation** remove any unused TBDs and better explanations
- **Increase GPT support** completely cover all functionality provided by Google Publisher tag
- **Code cleanup** - Cleaning up code to extract core GPT functionality. The end goal being to add unit test coverage and provide a **framework agnostic solution**
