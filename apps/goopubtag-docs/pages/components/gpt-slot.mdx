# GPTSlot

The `GPTSlot` is a component representing the Ad unit you want to display on the page.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { GPTSlot } from 'goopubtag';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Ad foo</p>
      <GPTSlot adUnit='abc/xyz' id='foo' />
      <p>Ad baz</p>
      <GPTSlot adUnit='abc/xyz' id='baz' />
    </div>
  );
};  

export default MyPage;
```

### `slotId`

This is the ad unit code for the ad unit to be displayed

### `networkId`

TBD

### `sizes`

Defines the sizes supported by the ad slot. To gain a better understanding, have a look at the following examples:

- [Ad sizes](/examples/ad_sizes)

Have a look also at our included [guidelines](/components/guidelines) for unit sizes.

### `outOfPage`

This prop determines the out of page behaviour, currently supporting the following types:

- `anchor`
- `rewarded`

The props are dynamic depending on the outOfPage `type` set. To gain a better understanding, have a look at the following examples:

- [Display Anchor Ad](/examples/display_anchor_ad)
- [Display Rewarded Ad](/examples/display_rewarded_ad)


### `fallback`

This prop specifies the global `collapseEmptyDivs` behaviour. Similar to `fallback` for `GPTProvider`, but with an extra option:

- `default`: Acts the same as if prop is not provided
- `expand`: Ad will initially take no space, and if filled will _expand_ to fill its space
- `expand_strict`: Ad will always take configured space, regardless of whether its filled
- `collapse`: Ad will initally take space configured, and if fails to fill will _collapse_ to no size.

### `adUnit`

This defines the parent-ad-unit-code at a top level for all contained ad slots.

### `sizeMapping`

Use this prop in conjunction with `sizes` for when you need to specify ad unit sizes per viewport size. To gain a better understanding, have a look at the following examples:

- [Ad sizes](/examples/ad_sizes)

Have a look also at our included [guidelines](/components/guidelines) for unit sizes and viewport sizes.

### `adSenseAttributes`

TBD 

### `targetingArguments`

This prop is a simple key-value object that defines the slot level targeting attributes for your GPT configuration.

### `onSlotLoad`

Takes a function that will be called when the slot has loaded. Takes an `event` argument which includes information about the slot.

### `onSlotIsViewable`

Takes a function that will be called when the slot is viewable on the page. Takes an `event` argument which includes information about the slot.

### `onSlotRenderEnded`

Takes a function that will be called when the slot is finished rendering. Takes an `event` argument which includes information about the slot.

### `shouldRefresh`

TBD
